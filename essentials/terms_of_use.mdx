## Article 4: Access and Use of Respaid Services

The Site allows the User to access and use the Services.

### 4.1 General Information About Respaid Services

#### 4.1.1 Transfer of Funds

This service is available to the User at a charge. Each transfer of funds to the User's bank account is subject to a charge calculated on the basis of a percentage of 0.86% of the transaction amount plus $0.77 USD, corresponding to the funds transfer fee. This percentage may be modified unilaterally by the Company.

#### 4.1.2 Account Activity

The Respaid Service is a free service subject to a fee if transactions are observed over thirty (30) rolling days. An account is considered active if it receives a payment over thirty (30) rolling days. In this case, an active account is charged $9.10 USD to the User.

#### 4.1.3 Settlement of Disputes

Any dispute by the Customer concerning a transaction must be referred to the Customer's bank. In the event of a disputed payment, Respaid undertakes to automatically reimburse the Customer, regardless of the Customer's means of payment. The dispute fee charged by the bank is $20.00 USD and is payable by Users, regardless of the origin of the dispute. Respaid undertakes to debit the User's Account within twenty-four (24) hours following payment by Respaid of the said fees.

#### 4.1.4 Validation of a Connected Account

##### 4.1.4.1 Justification for Collecting Supporting Documents

The "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations imposed by Respaid and its banking partner are regulatory requirements aimed at preventing abuses of the financial system. These obligations come from financial regulators. To create or reactivate a connected account, the banking partner Stripe requests specific information to verify the identity of users and the legitimacy of their business activities. This includes, but is not limited to:

- The identity of the person creating the account.
- The information of the company associated with the account.
- The identity of individuals who own more than 25% of the company.

For the activation or reactivation of an account, users must provide supporting documents to:

- Verify identity and prevent fraud.
- Comply with current financial regulations.
- Maintain a secure and reliable financial environment.

##### 4.1.4.2 Consequences of Non-activation or Suspension

If a connected account is restricted, any active campaign for the Creditor User will be suspended. If validation is not completed within five (5) days, the campaign will be canceled and subject to mass cancellation fees for all ongoing campaigns. If an account is not fully activated, no campaign can be launched.

##### 4.1.4.3 Non-validation or Restriction of a Connected Account

Validating an account involves sharing information that legitimizes the account to prevent fraud, in accordance with Stripe's KYC procedures. If an account is not fully activated, no campaign can be launched. If a connected account is restricted, the Creditor User will see any active campaign suspended. If validation is not completed within five (5) days, the campaign will be canceled and subject to mass cancellation fees for all ongoing campaigns.

### 4.2 Invoicing Tool

#### 4.2.1 Online Payment Service

The User benefits from online payment via the secure Respaid platform, whose transactions are managed by the Stripe platform, a payment integration solution. The use of this Service requires the creation of a Stripe account linked to the Respaid Account. No prior installation is required.

To register, the User fills in an information form with their name, phone number, email address and the bank information to which they wish to receive payment. The User undertakes to provide true, accurate, complete and up-to-date information. Should the User fail to provide such information, Respaid reserves the right to approve or oppose the opening of the Account, or to suspend or terminate the Account without prior notice.

Once the Account has been created, it can be accessed via Identifiers issued by Respaid. These Identifiers are strictly confidential and must not be divulged. In the event of theft or loss of the Identifiers, the User undertakes to inform Respaid without delay via the e-mail address of the person in charge of the Account, or in the absence of a reply within two (2) working days, via the following e-mail contact@respaid.com or, in the absence of a reply within two (2) working days, on the live chat which remains accessible via the "Support Center," so that Respaid can update them.

For each invoice issued, the User may either:

- Send their invoice from their Account to the Customer, who will receive an email enabling them to pay directly online; or
- Add a payment link to their PDF invoices that the Customer can use to pay online.

Payment can be made by credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or AMEX. Respaid undertakes to make the first payment for each new account within seven (7) days of receipt of the payment made by the Customer, in order to reduce the risks associated with the provision of payment services and to ensure an anti-fraud system. Once Respaid receives notification of successful payment, it takes five (5) days for the transfer to appear in the User's bank account. Subsequent payments will be sent within three (3) to five (5) working days.

#### 4.2.2 Bank Fees

The Online Payment Service involves charges calculated on the basis of a percentage corresponding to bank charges ("Bank Charges"). The Bank Charges consist of a percentage of 3.49% of the total amount of the transaction. A flat fee of $0.54 must be added, plus 0.85% of the amount. Bank Charges may be modified unilaterally by the Company upon thirty (30) working days' notice via email to Users. These Bank Charges will be borne either (i) by the Customer (if so agreed between the Customer and the User) or (ii) by the User, whose bank account will be credited with the amount paid by the Customer less the Bank Charges.

The "Invoicing" feature also offers the ability to make one-time or recurring payments ("subscriptions"). In the case of a subscription, an additional billing amounting to 0.85% of the total paid amount is applied.

### 4.3 Collection Feature: Debt Collection

#### 4.3.1 General Information

Respaid offers a Debt Collection Service. By using this service, the Creditor User gives Respaid a Mandate to collect their Debts amicably. This Mandate commits Respaid to an obligation of means, not results. Using this Service implies that the Creditor User, by completing the online amicable recourse form, has reviewed and accepted the general conditions for Recovery for all current and future files. No doubt or withdrawal on the part of the Creditor User regarding the Debts to be recovered is permitted.

**Obligation of Means (No Guarantee)**: Respaid does not guarantee that any specific debt will be recovered or recovered within a given timeframe.

**Post-Recovery Responsibility**: Once a debt is successfully recovered and fees have been collected, any subsequent dispute or refund request from the Debtor is the sole responsibility of the Creditor User. Respaid will not intervene or be held liable for such.

#### 4.3.2 Conditions for Using the Collection Service

- The Debt must be liquid, certain, and due.
- The Creditor User must have made prior unsuccessful attempts to recover the Debt (e.g., sending an invoice).
- The Debt must not be older than two and a half years.
- The individual Debts must exceed $5, with a minimum total Debt of $50 required to open a file.

Once an Account is placed in collection, the Creditor User must refrain from negotiating directly with the Debtor for that same Account and forward any Debtor communications to Respaid within two (2) business days.

#### 4.3.3 Commitments of the Parties

- The Creditor User commits to providing all elements likely to assist in recovering the Debt (e.g., terms of sale, any prior disputes). This information must be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
- The Creditor User commits to entrusting only certain, liquid, and due Debts; Respaid may immediately terminate the Collection procedure if these conditions are not met.
- The Creditor User must ensure the reliability of their payment method.
- The Creditor User must inform any internal teams of the Collection procedure to avoid internal obstacles.
- Once an attorney has contacted the Debtor Client, the Creditor User must not intervene or negotiate directly.
- The Creditor User guarantees the accuracy of information about the Debt's nature and amount and will provide supporting documents on request.
- The Creditor User must notify Respaid within 48 hours of any changes (e.g., partial payment, settlement).

#### 4.3.4 Procedure

All Collection procedures are carried out by a partnering attorney. Notifications are sent to debtors by email and text message, containing a payment link enabling debtors to clear their debts. The Creditor User authorizes Respaid to contact the Debtor Client on their behalf.

- **Payment Link**: Debtors can pay online via a secure payment link.
- **Direct Payment**: If the Debtor pays the User directly (e.g., wire transfer), the Creditor User agrees to notify Respaid within 48 hours.
- **Failed Procedure**: If amicable collection fails, Respaid may offer the possibility of legal action and connect the Creditor User with a law firm.
- **Amicable Settlement**: The Debtor Client and the Creditor User can agree on a settlement; the User must inform Respaid within 48 hours.

**Dispute Handling**

If the Debtor disputes the Debt, Respaid notifies the Creditor User by email. The Creditor User may decide to continue, re-evaluate, or cancel. In the absence of a response within four (4) working days, the file is canceled, and a Flat Fee is invoiced.

#### 4.3.5 Management of Confirmation Received Payments (CRP)

In certain cases, information obtained during recovery indicates that payment may have been made already, requiring validation or an update by the User.

##### 4.3.5.1 Definition of CRP

A CRP refers to a situation where a Debtor declares they have paid the User directly, or proof of payment is found but not reflected in the Respaid dashboard.

##### 4.3.5.2 CRP Management Process

- **Initial Notification**: Respaid emails the User describing the situation. The User has five (5) business days to respond.
- **Absence of Response**: If no response is received, Respaid updates the files based on available info (e.g., marks the invoice as paid).
- **Final Notification**: A final notification is sent, and the updates become final unless the User provides proof to the contrary within a reasonable time.

##### 4.3.5.3 Objectives of CRP

- Ensure proactive file management.
- Acknowledge recovery efforts.
- Prevent delays due to incomplete information.

##### 4.3.5.4 Transparency Requirement

If the User does not respond in time, Respaid treats the data provided as accurate and finalizes the updates accordingly.

#### 4.3.6 Payment Methods for Debtors

Debtors have several options:

1. **Payment via Personalized Link**: By credit card, with options for full payment, installment, or deferred payment.
2. **Direct Payment to the Mandating Entity**: The User must update the status once payment is received.
3. **Payment to the Partner Attorney's Office**: Debtors are informed that any payment sent directly to the partner attorney's office will not be processed.

#### 4.3.8 Status of Collection and Billing

Respaid deducts its fees from sums collected in accordance with the Mandate. Billing is based on the age of the invoice as indicated by the Mandate. In the event of success, Collection costs are calculated as a percentage of the Debt collected plus any applicable Flat Fees. In the event of cancellation, only the Flat Fees are invoiced.

#### 4.3.9 Destination of Funds

Respaid operates as a billing facilitator. When the Debtor pays using the Respaid payment link, funds go to the Creditor User's connected account (minus fees). If the Debtor pays the Creditor User directly, the Creditor User must provide proof and update the file accordingly.

#### 4.3.10 Statuses & Substatus

Files in Collection are assigned main statuses (Scheduled, In Progress, Finished, Recovered, etc.) and substatuses (e.g., Via Respaid, Paid Directly to the Provider) to indicate details of payment or file evolution.

- **Status: Scheduled** – Campaign is planned but not yet started.
- **Status: In Progress** – Collection campaign has launched; notifications and actions are underway.
- **Status: Finished** – All scheduled notifications/reminders have been sent, but follow-up can continue as long as the Mandate is valid.
- **Status: Recovered** – Debt is fully settled, either via Respaid's link or directly with the Creditor User.
- **Status: Canceled** – The file is closed. Once canceled, it cannot be reactivated. Associated fees may apply.
- **Status: Disputed** – The Debtor has issued a reasoned dispute; the Creditor User must respond within four (4) business days.
- **Status: Insolvent** – The Debtor is insolvent or over-indebted.
- **Status: Installment Payment** – An installment plan has been established with the Debtor.
- **Status: Deferred Payment** – Payment is deferred to a specified date.
- **Status: Partial Payment** – Only a portion of the debt has been paid.

**Substatus Examples**

- **Via Respaid**: Payment or installment was made using Respaid's link.
- **Paid Directly to the Provider**: Debtor settled directly with the Creditor User.
- **Already Paid**: The debt was paid before the file reached Respaid.

##### 4.3.10.4 Insurance

Each Party holds an insurance policy covering the financial consequences of its civil liability if engaged.

#### 4.3.11 Mandate

The mandate signed before any amicable Collection procedure is a contract between the Creditor User and Respaid. It governs the rights and obligations of the parties. Upon termination, obligations that naturally persist (liability, confidentiality, etc.) remain.

By accepting the Mandate, the Creditor User acknowledges that all fees and charges collected by Respaid and its legal partners for services rendered in the recovery process are final and non-refundable upon successful recovery. Once recovery is completed, Respaid is not involved in subsequent refund decisions or disputes.

#### 4.3.12 Non-Waiver

The User commits not to renounce a launched campaign. No withdrawal on Debt recovery is accepted without cancellation fees. Fees related to Collection or subscription remain due and cannot be canceled after fulfilling the Creditor User's commitments.

### 4.4 Subscription Terms and Plans

#### 4.4.1 Access and Payment

A subscription grants access to the Respaid platform and its features, independently of actual usage. The subscription must be paid in advance; otherwise, the tools cannot be used. The subscription provides access to services but does not include the sending of collection campaigns. Respaid offers annual or monthly subscription plans (Standard, Premium, Enterprise). These subscriptions are individually assigned and non-transferable.

#### 4.4.2 Default of Payment and Mass Cancellation

If the subscription remains unpaid for more than six (6) business days, all collection activities on ongoing campaigns will be canceled (mass cancellation). Payment links will also be deactivated. Without a subscription, launching new collection campaigns is impossible.

#### 4.4.3 Changing Subscription Terms

1. **Annual Subscriptions**: Rates paid in one lump sum upon subscription are guaranteed throughout the committed period. Changes take effect only at the end of the current period.
2. **Monthly Subscriptions**: Rates may be modified by Respaid with at least thirty (30) working days' notice via email. If the Creditor User does not accept the new rates, they may terminate the subscription without penalty before the new rate's effective date.

#### 4.4.4 Termination of Subscription

1. **General Termination Terms**
   - The Creditor User can terminate at any time and will retain Service access until the end of the current billing period.
   - Subscriptions auto-renew unless terminated by email to support@respaid.com at least fifteen (15) working days before each renewal.
   - For more details on pricing and conditions of the various subscriptions, see respaid.com/pricing.
2. **Effect of Termination on Collection Fees**
   Even after subscription ends or campaigns are canceled, Respaid remains entitled to charge any success-based Collection Fees if a Debtor eventually pays due to prior collection efforts. If a Debtor pays within twelve (12) months of Respaid's last action or contact, the Collection Fees remain due.
3. **Late Payment Penalties**
   Late payments may incur interest at 1.5% per month (or the maximum permitted by law), plus an administrative fee of $40 for each late payment, or actual costs if higher and allowed by law.
4. **Ending the Subscription and Effects on Ongoing Services**
   - No new campaigns can be launched once the subscription ends, but existing campaigns may continue until they conclude. Fees remain due for any successful recoveries resulting from Respaid's efforts.
5. **Use of Client Logos**
   By using the services, clients grant Respaid the right to use their logos for case study presentations or display on Respaid's communication materials.

The user's continued use of the Respaid platform confirms acceptance of the MDSAI.
