# Balancing Urgency, Business Impact, and Feasibility

## Introduction
The proposed prioritization framework aims to balance urgency, business impact, and feasibility. This approach maintains a steady flow of regular development work while effectively handling urgent issues.

## Framework Overview

### 1. Urgency Levels (U)
Defines how quickly a task needs to be addressed based on its impact on business operations.

| **Urgency (U) Level**           | **Definition & Example Scenarios**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Action & Expected Response Time**                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **U1 - Critical (Same-Day Fix)** | **üö® System outage, major security issue, direct financial loss, legal/compliance risk.**<br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- Client-facing payment issues (security errors, failed transactions).<br />- Blocked customer action due to system failure (e.g., client unable to complete a required task).<br />- AI Automation failure affecting live production.<br />- Incorrect fees or critical financial miscalculations. | **Immediate action required.**<br /><br />- Fix within the *same business day*.<br />- If complex (F3), implement a **temporary workaround** + plan for a full fix.                                  |
| **U2 - High Priority (Resolve within 3 Days)** | **‚ö†Ô∏è Direct impact on revenue or customer experience, but not a total failure.**<br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- AI feature malfunction affecting customer interaction but not completely broken.<br />- Bug preventing access to non-critical documents or data.<br />- Email notifications failing but workarounds exist.                                                                                     | **Should be resolved within 3 days.**<br /><br />- May require triage but should not delay other high-priority sprint work.                                                                         |
| **U3 - Medium Priority (Resolve within the Week)** | **üìÖ Affects user experience or operational efficiency but does not cause immediate loss.**<br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- Feature requests to improve AI notifications.<br />- Design/UI inconsistencies (e.g., missing logo in sign-in flow).<br />- Backend report enhancements that improve insights.                                                                                                          | **Planned for resolution within the current or next sprint.**<br /><br />- May be combined with other related improvements.                                                                         |
| **U4 - Low Priority (Backlog/Future Consideration)** | **üîÑ Nice-to-have improvements, low-impact bugs, minor UI/UX issues.**<br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- Cosmetic UI issues that do not block functionality.<br />- Backend process optimizations that do not immediately affect operations.                                                                                                                        | **Added to backlog** for future review.<br /><br />- May be scheduled in future sprints if resources allow.                                                                                        |

### 2. Business Value Levels (B)
Defines the impact of the task on the business.

| **Business Impact (BR) Level**                                | **Definition & Example Scenarios**                                                                                                                                                           | **Impact on Operations & Revenue**                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BR1 - High Impact (Critical Business Functionality)**       | **üí∞ Direct financial impact, major compliance/legal risk, or serious customer disruption.** <br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- Payment processing failures or incorrect fees.<br />- Legal compliance issues that need correction.<br />- Customer unable to complete core actions due to system issues.                                                              | üö® Severe consequences if not fixed quickly.<br /><br />- Likely to cause revenue loss, legal issues, or major customer frustration.                                                                                                                                          |
| **BR2 - Medium Impact (Operational or Functional Disruptions)** | **‚öôÔ∏è Operational inefficiencies, moderate customer inconvenience, performance issues.** <br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- AI Automation needs improvement but is still functioning.<br />- Customers facing delays due to inefficient processes.<br />- Users struggling with UI clarity but still able to complete tasks.                                         | ‚ö†Ô∏è Affects efficiency & user experience but does not cause immediate financial damage.<br /><br />- Should be addressed in a timely manner to prevent long-term negative impact.                                                                                          |
| **BR3 - Low Impact (Minor Enhancements & UX Improvements)**   | **‚ú® Quality-of-life improvements, minor UI/UX tweaks, backend optimizations.** <br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- Enhancing AI reports with extra data.<br />- Adding UI elements to improve navigation but not fix a major issue.                                                                                        | üîÑ Improves user experience or internal efficiency but does not cause operational failures.<br /><br />- Added to backlog for future consideration.                                                                                                                         |

## Priority Decision Matrix
This matrix helps determine the priority and appropriate action based on the combination of **Urgency (U)**, **Business Value (B)**, and **Feasibility (F)**.

| **Urgency (U) \ Business Value (B)** | **B1 (High Impact)**                                                    | **B2 (Medium Impact)**                                                         | **B3 (Low Impact)**                                                              |
